Feature: Checked Move for King
Problem: While Iteratively checking the reach of each opponent's piece to the King's next position,
         The Chess-Engine API check the Currents Position of the King & not the Next

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proposed Solution:- (i)  Clone the ChessSquare Board with the King's Position moved to next position and
                         perform the Iteratively reach algorithm on this ChessSquare.
                    (ii) Correct the API to behave in such a way that the FROM POSITION isn't consider as
                         the TO POSITION is given more importance.
